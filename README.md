- IMPORTANT (Please read first)
- I wrote this system on Linux(Ubuntu), so some things (buttons, texts, etc.) appear in the wrong places for Windows users, so I made (form.resizable(width=True, height=True)), that is, you can enlarge the window as you wish, but the appearance may be a little bad. If you are using Linux it will work without any problems. It runs smoothly in the Windows environment, but some things may be slightly different or incorrect. But as a result, it will work properly on every system. (There may be differences only in appearance)

- First you need to create an account and then log in.
- For the billing system, first add a name, then add a number, then you can choose what you want from the menu and invoice.
- If the invoice has been paid, you can delete the account by pressing delete.
- You can reset or update the menu
- If you press total, you can view the total invoice.
